<p>This website is proudly hosted by Rbind.io, the #rstat community domain dedicated to website development. It’s running thanks a list of spicy ingredients like R blogdown, Hugo, GitHub, R Markdown and Netlify. In this post I’d like to take you through the different steps that I took to build it.</p>

<p>This post is based on the webinar that I had the pleasure to give thanks to a kind invitation of the R Ladies community of Amsterdam.</p>
