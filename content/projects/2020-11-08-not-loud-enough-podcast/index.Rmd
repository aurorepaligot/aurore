I've been invited by my dear friends Canan Marasligil and Laura M. Pana to talk about my journey from linguistics to Data Science during a special episode of **[Not Loud Enough](http://www.migrationlab.org/podcast)** podcast. We discuss data, sign languages, artificial intelligence, inclusion and much more.

One of the aspects that we addressed is the use of artificial intelligence to facilitate the accessibility of online contents. For this podcast, I tested some speech recognition programs to help me transcribe the episode and I ended up selecting [Otter.ai](https://otter.ai/). You can download the full transcript here :

I was absolutely amazed by the quality of this AI, which works for various varieties of English and has a reliable accent recognition system for the speakers of English as a second language, thus opening up the tool for a diverse audience. Apart from a few errors, the speech recognition system was almost perfect and even faithfully preserved my grammatical and pronunciation mistakes which I left in the transcript for the sake of audio fidelity as well as a question of resources. 

As you can imagine, proper names were of course the most difficult elements to be reconstructed by the AI given that they were not part of the data set it got fed with. I leave you here the funiust mistakes.
